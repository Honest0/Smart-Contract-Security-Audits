Conclusion
The issues identified were minor in nature, and do not affect the security of the contract.

Additionally, the code implements and uses a SafeMath contract, which defines functions for safe math operations that will throw errors in the cases of integer overflow or underflows. The simplicity of the audited contracts contributed greatly to their security. The usage of the widely used framework OpenZeppelin, reduced the attack surface.
